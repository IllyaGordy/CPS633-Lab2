CPS633
======

This is a working project for Lab2 of CPS633 course from Ryerson University

CPS 633 - LAB #2 - README



This readme contains brief descriptions with regards to the functionality of all programs written in C for this project, i.e. questions 1, 2. There are also instructions provided for compiling each solution.

***IMPORTANT NOTE*** The applications were written on a Linux system (Ubuntu) using a different version of the GCC compiler than that used on the moon.scs.ryerson.ca server. As a result, question 1 and 2 solution works as intended on my Linux VM, but may not function correctly on the Ryerson moon server.
